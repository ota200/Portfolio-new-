            <p> I am staring at this clear azure sky, marshmallow-like clouds at the top, with grassy green rolling hills on the bottom. It is something I see often, then it disappears. I never understand why it’s a sky, or why it disappears. It's just something that is always there. Every Time it's only me who is there. Alone,  I am eventually put into the void, that's always been there too. That sky world, the void, and me. That's how it went and how it always has been. One time I tried to go over the hills, but they kept going more and more hills, on and on and on, forever. Sometimes I wonder how I got there, I try remembering, far into the past, but only the azure sky comes to mind. There are other times when I feel like there is something more, I get this itch in my mind, whenever I am in the void like something is trying to push me. Usually, I would ignore that itch but one day I didn't, letting it take me. It brought my father into the, I was hesitant to move on, already trying to escape this place of isolation through the void, but that itch started to become stronger.I moved on. On and on, the void is endless, but I kept going, I don't know why, I don't know how, but I did. The hills came into view, the void disappearing but there was something different about them, they had no grass and weren't green, they were azure blue. The hills were the sky, the sky the hills. That itch of a thumping sensation in my head stopped. The world started flashing from the void to the sky, void to hills, void to clouds. Everything was changing, then something really weird happened: the sky turned yellow and the ground turned black.

            Pain, intense pain. All over from the sole of my feet to my head, blistering pain that I could feel in my brain. It was as if I was thrown from space and back. Pain with darkness, pure darkness. I close my eyes, pitch-black I open my eyes darkness. I can’t move because of the intense pain and all, I have been lying here for hours, days? Weeks? Somehow I am still alive even though I have had no food for ages. I don’t know why or how or when were what, the heck this black darkness I … I can’t remember anything about my past all I have to know is this darkness. Sometimes like however long ago ( weeks maybe? ), I will get this intense pain, as I have known, and it would go away for ages, and when it does go away it’s sudden as if it was never there.  Sometimes I heard weird sounds, mostly muffled, most of the time it's this whrwhrwhr. It gets louder and louder and louder. I always imagine that it’s some sort of robot that could get me out of here. That’s the only thing I remember of my past, the robots, metal machines, those glowing eyes. Dreams of getting out of this place, I have tried a few times, running and seemingly getting nowhere, I am still doing it actually, trying to move farther and farther into the never-ending darkness. Somewhere in me, I know that there’s more to my past than the robots, and I want the freedom to know. The pain suddenly stopped, using one of my arms, I realigned my body and continued traveling through the impenetrable void.

            Blinding light coming from high above, piercing through the darkness. It was amazing and terrifying, it would have made an incredible dream

          <p title="This was going to a poem but sort of just morphed into this really random snipet">The boy ran from the chaos of the land going.
            He then jumped into the air riding the clouds.
            Blasting with all his might.
            He floated in space looking down at the chaos on his planet.
            Annnnnnnnd , he was struck by a coment , quickly hurled into a new location. 
           The boy floated in space thinking that was all the damage and tried to find out his location, until he realized he was lost in space and a arian in space is never a good thing.
           He starts trying to pump his legs. 
           He runs as fast as he can, not thinking of his surroundings, hoping that he will crash into a planet.
           And as most of you people expected he went on fallssly running and running and running and  . . .  whats that he crashes into a planet instead, wait but my script  . . . its all wrong oh uh. Forget everything I just said 
           This is actually a story about a man u would become king or oh what that oh you ment take the last few sentences OH.
